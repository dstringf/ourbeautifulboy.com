# www.ourbeautifulboy.com

Deploys www.ourbeautifulboy.com to an S3 hosted website, configures access logging to a secondary bucket and maintains R53 zone.   A third party DNS registrar is used and points to AWS R53 NS servers outside of this deployment.


The website serves as a memorial to my late son Joey who passed away in 2015.
